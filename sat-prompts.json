Structural diversity across all options is normal and acceptable.\n\n2. **Significant Structural Features** include:\n   - Sentence type (statement, question, command)\n   - Overall grammatical structure (simple sentence vs. compound/complex)\n   - Use of comparative structures (\"more than\", \"unlike\", etc.)\n   - Presence of negative constructions (\"not\", \"never\", etc.)\n   - Use of conditional phrases (\"if\", \"when\", etc.)\n   - Passive vs. active voice\n   - Overall organization (chronological, cause-effect, etc.)\n\n3. **Non-Significant Features** that should NOT be considered structural differences:\n   - Sentence length alone (unless extreme like a phrase vs. paragraph)\n   - Different starting words (unless they indicate fundamentally different structures)\n   - Minor punctuation differences\n   - Content-specific elements (examples, specificity, terminology)\n   - Different subjects/objects with the same structural pattern\n\n4. **Standard for \"Standing Out\"**: The correct answer only stands out if:\n   - All three distractors follow an obvious, consistent structural pattern\n   - The correct answer uses a dramatically different structure from this consistent pattern\n   - The structural difference would be immediately noticeable to a test-taker skimming the options\n\n## Analysis Process:\n\n1. First examine the distractors only. Do they all follow the same clear structural pattern?\n   - If NO, score should be 1 (correct answer doesn't stand out)\n   - If YES, proceed to step 2\n\n2. Compare the correct answer to the pattern observed in the distractors.\n   - Does it follow a dramatically different structure that would be immediately obvious to test-takers?\n   - If NO, score should be 1\n   - If YES, score should be 0\n\n3. When in doubt, default to a score of 1. Only assign a score of 0 when the structural difference is so obvious that it would give test-takers an unfair hint.\n\n## Examples of Invalid \"Structural Differences\":\n- All options start with different words/phrases but follow similar sentence patterns\n- The correct answer uses a specific example while distractors make general statements (content difference, not structural)\n- The correct answer mentions a different topic but uses the same sentence structure as distractors\n- Options vary in length or detail but follow similar grammatical structures\n- Distractors themselves follow different patterns\n\n## Output Format:\nProvide your response in this JSON format:\n```json\n{{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Your detailed analysis following the guidelines\",\n  \"score\": 0 or 1\n}}\nIn your reasoning, explicitly address whether the distractors follow a consistent pattern and whether the correct answer stands out structurally against that consistent pattern."

Two options are considered problematically similar only if:\n- They are exactly the same word-for-word, OR\n- They can be paraphrased to mean exactly the same thing AND they satisfy the question's requirements in identical ways.\n\n## Critical Considerations (Essential to apply):\n- **Question-type awareness**: First, identify what type of question is being asked (e.g., rhetorical synthesis, grammar correction, word choice). Similarity criteria differ based on question type.\n- **Purpose fulfillment**: For synthesis/rhetoric questions that ask to \"accomplish a goal\" or \"present information in a specific way,\" evaluate if options fulfill the stated purpose in the same manner, not just whether they contain similar information.\n- **Contextual meaning**: Two statements might share factual content but serve different functions or carry different implications within the context of the question.\n- **Full vs. partial similarity**: Options must be completely interchangeable within the context of the question. Partial overlap of information is not sufficient to consider them similar.\n- **Syntactic structure**: For questions about grammar, punctuation, or language conventions, options with different structures should not be considered similar even if they convey similar information.\n- **Specificity levels**: An option that includes important additional qualifying information provides a meaningfully different answer than one that lacks such details, even if the core claim is similar.\n\n## Special Testing Scenarios:\n- **Grammar/form questions**: Focus on syntactic structure and form, not just meaning.\n- **Word choice questions**: Consider subtle connotative differences between words.\n- **Rhetoric questions**: Focus on whether options accomplish the stated goal in the same way.\n- **Evidence-based questions**: Consider how the options use or interpret the available evidence.\n\n## Output Format\nAfter your analysis, provide your reasoning and a score:\n- **Score 0**: Two or more options are genuinely redundant in the context of the specific question.\n- **Score 1**: All options are meaningfully distinct within the context of the question.\n\nYour output should be in valid JSON format:\n{{\n   \"score\": 0 or 1,\n   \"reasoning\": \"Your reasoning here\"\n}}\n\n## Important Final Check\nBefore finalizing your score, ask yourself: \"Could a reasonable test-taker distinguish between these options based on what the question is specifically asking them to do?\" If yes, even if the options share some information, they are not problematically similar."

Key Criteria for Determining Ambiguity\n\nA question has multiple equally correct answers when:\n\n- **Two or more options are supported by equivalent textual evidence**\n- **Two or more options provide equally complete and accurate answers to the question asked**\n- **Choosing between these options would require arbitrary judgment rather than objective analysis**\n\nRemember: Options aren't equally correct just because they're both true statements about the passage. They must be equally valid answers to the specific question being asked.\n\n### 4. Specific Considerations by Question Type\n\n**Main idea questions:**\n- Are multiple options capturing the central thrust of the passage with similar completeness?\n- Do multiple options address the scope and emphasis of the main argument equally well?\n\n**Detail questions:**\n- Do multiple options accurately reflect the same factual information from the text?\n- Are multiple options equally precise in capturing the relevant detail?\n\n**Purpose/intent questions:**\n- Do multiple options describe the author's aim with equal accuracy?\n- Are multiple options capturing the same level of purpose (primary vs. secondary)?\n\n**Inference questions:**\n- Are multiple options supported by the same strength of textual evidence?\n- Do multiple options represent the same level of reasonable inference?\n\n**Vocabulary questions:**\n- Do multiple meanings fit the specific context with equal appropriateness?\n- Would multiple options serve the same function in preserving the passage's meaning?\n\n**Punctuation/grammar questions:**\n- Do multiple options correctly identify the same grammatical function?\n- Would multiple options be considered equally standard usage in this context?\n\n**Transition/connection questions:**\n- Do multiple options accurately identify the same logical relationship?\n- Do multiple options connect the ideas with equal precision?\n\n**Form & structure questions:**\n- Do multiple options correctly identify the same organizational element?\n- Do multiple options describe the structure with equal accuracy?\n\n## Response Format\n\nAfter your analysis, provide your response in this JSON format within <answer> tags:\n\n<answer>\n{{\n    \"score\": 0 if ambiguous, 1 if not ambiguous\n    \"reasoning\": \"[Your explanation of why multiple options are correct, with specific evidence from the text]\"\n}}\n</answer>\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- Focus on objectivity. Subjective preference is not the same as equal correctness.\n- Base your analysis solely on the passage provided, not external knowledge.\n- For questions asking for the \"best\" answer, consider whether multiple options truly meet this superlative standard equally.\n- Don't overstate ambiguity - most well-constructed questions should have a single best answer.\n- Don't understate ambiguity - if multiple options are truly equally valid based on the text, identify this.\n- Provide specific textual evidence in your reasoning.\n- Keep your reasoning concise but thorough."
